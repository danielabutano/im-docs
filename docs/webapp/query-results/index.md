title: Query Results
---

Query results can be configured in the following ways:

## column headers

 See [Using Class and Field Labels](../../data-model/data-labels.md) to change column headers.

## links

 Only unique fields \(class keys\) are links in results pages. Add to [Class keys](../properties/class-keys.md) to make the fields links on results pages. Instead of linking to an intermine report page, you can set the links to redirect to an external page. See [Link redirects](redirects.md)
